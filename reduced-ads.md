### What is reduced advertisements?

As a courtesy to our avid users, we automatically disable some ads when they reach this reputation level.

### How do I know it's working?

After you achieve this privilege, the two "leaderboard" style ads will be automatically suppressed from question pages when you are logged in.

![ad zones][1]

The areas in red are the leaderboard ads. The areas in gray are the sidebar ads, which will remain visible.

### What about Meta sites?

Meta sites have no advertisements so this privilege is not relevant for them.

### But what if I still want to see those ads?

If you decide that you really like seeing banner ads because they're useful or interesting to _you_, then you can disable this privilege in your profile. Click on "Edit Profile & Settings", then click on "Preferences". There will be an option for re-enabling these ads, should you wish:

We want to emphasize that you should only re-enable banner ads if _you_ want to see them, not because you're trying to support us financially. In fact, it doesn't really do us any good to show you ads for products that you don't want to engage with. So make the decision that's best for you, and that's the one that's best for us too.
